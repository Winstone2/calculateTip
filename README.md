# calculateTip
Here's how you can approach this:

    Understand the Inputs: You have two input parameters: the bill amount and the tip percentage. Make sure the bill amount is a number and the tip percentage is a valid percentage (between 0 and 100).

    Calculate the Tip: To calculate the tip, you need to multiply the bill amount by the tip percentage (in decimal form, e.g., 15% as 0.15).

    Return the Result: Return the calculated tip value as the output of the function.
    In this example, the calculateTip function takes the bill amount and tip percentage as arguments. It first checks if the inputs are valid (both numbers and a valid tip percentage range), then calculates the tip using the provided formula, and finally returns the calculated tip value.

Remember to adjust the example usage with your desired bill amount and tip percentage values.

Please note that this example assumes that the tip percentage is a whole number (like 15) and not a fraction (like 0.15). If you want to allow both percentage forms, you can modify the function accordingly.
